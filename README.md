## 👋 Hey there, and welcome!

I'm Carolina – a curious web development student with a background in digital marketing and a strong passion for e-commerce and tech.

## 💡 About Me

My previous experience with websites, social media, and online campaigns has given me a solid foundation in how digital solutions can drive business growth.

Now, I’m diving deep into **full-stack development** with a focus on:

- 🌐 HTML, CSS & TypeScript  
- ⚙️ PHP & backend technologies  
- 🧩 Third-party integrations  
- 🛍️ E-commerce (currently building my own **beauty shop**!)

My goal? To create **scalable**, **user-friendly**, and **business-driven** web solutions that deliver real value – both for users and companies.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm focused on:

- Deepening my PHP and backend development skills  
- Integrating third-party systems (e.g. payment solutions, product databases)  
- Building a custom beauty e-commerce platform ✨  

At the same time, I'm exploring topics like system architecture, security, and writing clean, maintainable code.
