# 👋 Hey there, and welcome!

I'm Carolina, a web development student with a background in digital marketing and a strong passion for e-commerce and tech.

## 💡 About Me

My previous experience with websites, social media, and online campaigns has given me a solid foundation in how digital solutions can drive business growth.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

🔭 I'm currently working on **my portfolio**, using Next.js, React & tailwind to build a high functional site. 

🔙 A previous project of mine was a custom **beauty e-commerce shop**. Where I focused on PHP, backend logic & third-party integrations.

🌱 I’m learning more about **backend architecture**, API integrations, and clean code principles.

⭐️ My goal? To create **scalable**, **user-friendly**, and **business-driven** web solutions that deliver real value for both users and companies.

At the same time, I'm exploring topics like system architecture, security, and writing clean, maintainable code.
